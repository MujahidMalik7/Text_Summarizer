# Real-Time Text Summarizer

**Automatic Text Summarization using Hugging Face Transformers in Python.**

---

## Project Description

**Real-Time Text Summarizer** is a Python project that generates concise, coherent summaries from long articles or text inputs using **state-of-the-art transformer models** from Hugging Face. It demonstrates practical implementation of **abstractive text summarization**, allowing users to condense information quickly and effectively. The project also includes evaluation using **ROUGE scores** to measure summary quality against reference summaries.

## Features

- Summarizes user-provided text into a clear, shorter version.  
- Supports pre-trained models like **BART** for high-quality abstractive summaries.  
- Adjustable summary length for tailored results.  
- Includes **ROUGE-based evaluation** for performance comparison.

---

## Usage

1. Load the summarizer model.  
2. Provide the text input to summarize.  
3. Generate the summary.  
4. Evaluate summary quality using ROUGE scores (optional).

## Future Work

- Add support for multiple pre-trained models (T5, Pegasus) for comparison.  
- Implement automatic chunking for very long texts.  
- Create a simple GUI or web interface for easier interaction.  
- Fine-tune models on custom datasets for improved summarization quality.
